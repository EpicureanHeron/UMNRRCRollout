    <p>Chrome River is the University’s new Travel & Expense tool for reconciling Travel Card transactions and requesting reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. Over the next few weeks we will be meeting with you and your financial leadership team to discuss resources that will help your unit transition from the paper process to Chrome River and integrate the Travel Card into your suite of payment methods.</p>

<h2 style="color: #7A0019">On-Boarding</h2>

    <p>Here are some things to begin thinking about as we begin your on-boarding process and answer your preliminary questions. </p>

<h3>Videos</h3>

    <p>There are two videos that we invite you watch prior to our visit with you. These short videos provide a high level view of Chrome River and a demonstration of the system. <p>
    
    <p>Share these videos with everyone in your unit and at staff meetings.</p>

        <div style="font-size: .8em">*Note, If closed captioning is needed for the system demonstration, this same video with captioning is available via the Training Hub. <a  target="_blank" href="https://training.umn.edu/courses/11500">Follow this link</a>, click enroll, view details, launch the course, and select the video called Demo: Reporting Expenses in Chrome River. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working for a better solution for captioning.</div>

<h3>Pre-Approvals</h3>

    <p>Pre-Approvals in Chrome River allow for individuals to plan for a trip by providing a business justification and estimate their expenses. Pre-Approvals are optional by default in Chrome River. Each college/administrative unit may decide to require a Pre-Approval in Chrome River prior to making travel arrangements. Pre-Approvals route to the individual’s supervisor for approval. This is the only approval routing that is configured in Chrome River for a Pre-Approval. Regardless of whether your unit uses Pre-Approvals or not, the system is configured so that <strong>all</strong> expense reports will route to the individual’s supervisor for approval, along with all other predefined required approvals. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Consider whether required Pre-Approvals are right for your college/administrative unit. We need to know your decision at least two weeks before your scheduled go-live date so it can be programmed into Chrome River.</li>
        
    </ul>


<h3>Approvals</h3>
    <p>Here’s the order of review for Expense Report transactions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Supervisor (from HRMS, the person’s “Reports To”)</li>
        <li>Financial approver (EFS primary approver for Expenses)</li>
        <li>Certified approver (when activity hits sponsored accounts)</li>
        <li>For some rarely encountered compliance rules, there are routings to the Chief Financial Manager or Controller</li>
        <li>If over $10,000, Accounting Services</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Chrome River does not allow for a pool of alternates but it does have a vacation alternate feature. The University Financial Helpline can reroute activity in Chrome River, similar to how it’s done in EFS.</p>
    <p>    Approvals cannot be customized for colleges/administrative units within Chrome River.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validate that the Primary Approver in EFS for Expense Reports is who you would like the approver to be in Chrome River. Make these changes as you would any other approver updates for EFS.
    </li>
        </ul>


<h3>HR Listing</h3>
    <p>Supervisors are now approving in the system instead of on paper. During the pilot some units discovered a disconnect between who they expected the supervisor to be and the supervisor as listed in HRMS. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will share with you a list of supervisor/employee relationships for your college/administrative unit as they will appear in Chrome River. The system is using supervisor/employee relationships that originate in HRMS and are passed through EFS to Chrome River. If the relationship is not correct, please work with your HR pro and HR staff to ensure job records are updated as appropriate.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Delegates for Preparing Expense Reports</h3>
    <p>While the system offers delegate functionality, delegate use is not encouraged. The most efficient way to use the Chrome River system is for travelers/employees to create and submit their own expense reports. During our pilot we asked individuals to create their own expense reports and had 88% participation. </p>

    <p>Overall the feedback from pilot participants was positive, acknowledging that following the best practices built in the system really does make good sense for the University. Individuals who must authorize a delegate for themselves have to log in to Chrome River and grant that access person by person. People cannot authorize themselves to be delegates for others, as can be done in EFS. If a delegate does create (or edit) an Expense Report for someone, the system will require the traveler/employee to submit their own expense report, obtaining the traveler/employee electronic signature. It’s this feature that allows us to get rid of the paper process (a major driver for implementing the new system). </p>    
    
<h3>Build Local Expertise: Designate a Chrome River Navigator</h3>
    <p>As was done with the PeopleSoft upgrade a few years ago, we suggest that you designate a few key people to complete our Chrome River Navigator Orientation to become local experts about the system and provide assistance to people in your college who might have questions or need help getting started. These local experts understand your operations and can better provide personal assistance to faculty and staff in your area when creating their first expense reports.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider which individual(s) in your college/administrative unit might best provide one-on-one assistance to faculty and staff. We need the name(s) at least three weeks before your scheduled go-live date.</li>
            
        </ul>

<h3>Chrome River Analytics</h3>
    <p>Chrome River has a powerful analytics tool that can be made available to a very small number of people at the University. As part of this rollout, each Chief Financial Manager, Cluster Director, RRC Contact, and Department Card Administrators will be granted access to Chrome River Analytics to aid in monitoring activity, pulling activity to make projections for budgeting, and responding to inquiries from college or University leaders. On an as-needed basis, you may request this access for a few additional key staff such as your collegiate data analyst. Please include the name(s) of those who should have this access on your Checklist in the Google Drive Folder (more on that below) or email us at <a href="mailto:travel@umn.edu">travel@umn.edu</a>. (Keep in mind that much of this data will also eventually be in the data warehouse.)</p>
    

<h3>Travel Card</h3>

    <p>The Travel Card is available to any employee who travels, irrespective of the number of times they travel. Not all employees can afford to pay up front for travel costs or wait for reimbursement. In addition to this convenience for employees, the Travel Card helps the University better track and contain costs. Using the card along with Chrome River speeds up the Expense Report process, since much of the required information will already be in the system by virtue of having used the card and uploading images of receipts.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>In the next few days we will share with you additional information on ordering Travel Cards. It will include a list of current PCard and American Express cardholders within your unit and instructions on how to close accounts if necessary.</li>
        <li>If you want a list of your department card administrators, request it via email to <a href="mailto:controller@umn.edu">controller@umn.edu</a>.</li>
        
        <li><a target=”_blank” href="https://travel.umn.edu/docs/TravelCardApp.docx">A Travel Card application (docx)</a> must be completed for each person who needs a card. Instructions for submitting applications will also be provided to you. We encourage all travelers to apply for a Travel Card.</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p><strong><em>What’s happening with the American Express Travel Card program?</em></strong> This program is being eliminated. Cardholders will be contacted by Purchasing Services with details about the closure of their account and any payment arrangements. Individual colleges/administrative units and departments do not need to take any steps to close out American Express Travel Cards.</p>
